    <h1>Top 5 Twitch Emotes!</h1>

    
    
    <div id="monkaS" class="parallax"></div>
        <article class="popis">
            <h2>MonkaS</h2>
            <p><strong>MonkaS is used during high-tension moments in a Twitch stream. Whenever a nerve-wracking or scary moment occurs during a Twitch stream, the chat will start spamming MonkaSes.</strong></p>
            <p>The MonkaS is a Twitch emote featuring a wide-eyed, sweating Pepe the frog, signifying that he is in distress.</p>

    <div id="pepega" class="parallax"></div>
        <article class="popis">
            <h2>Pepega</h2>
            <p><strong>Pepega is used when a streamer does something stupid on stream.</strong></p>
            <p>Pepega isn’t the nicest of Twitch emotes and generally, the emote is spammed by chat to make fun of a streamer’s actions.</p>
         </article>
    <div id="kappa" class="parallax"></div>
        <article class="popis">
            <h2>Kappa</h2>
            <p><strong>The Kappa emote is a black and white face cut-out of a former Twitch Employee. The emote, which features a smug-looking face, is often used to mock the Twitch streamer.</strong></p>
            <p>On top of being a “troll” emote, using the Kappa emote may reveal a user has the golden Kappa. Due to its rarity, once a chatter begins using the Kappa emoji, it often gets spammed by others to check if they too have the golden Kappa.</p>
        </article>
    <div id="jebaited" class="parallax"></div>
        <article class="popis">
            <h2>Jebaited</h2>
            <p><strong>Jebaited is a Twitch emote featuring the face of Alex Jebailey looking up in the air.</strong></p>
            <p>Jebaited basically means baiting out an opponent in a video game but it can also be used to troll or ‘bait’ a friend or Twitch streamer into doing somethng stupid on stream.</p>

    <div id="lul" class="parallax"></div>
        <article class="popis">
            <h2>LUL</h2>
            <p><strong>The LUL emote depicts a stylized version of the late TotalBiscuits laughing face. This emote is used whenever something funny or laughable appears on stream.</strong></p>
            <p>LUL can be understood as ‘Lame Uncomfortable Laugh’ but the naming of this emote has nothing to do with that. LUL was simply the name that was given to the emote when its predecessor was first uploaded to BTTV.</p>
